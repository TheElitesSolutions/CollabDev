### 1. Project Group Member(s)
- Names & IDs:  Joe Jneid – A2220041  

### 2. Project Abstract
- Brief Description (<= 50 words):  
  - CollabDev + is a hybrid collaborative IDE and website builder that integrates 
coding, design, communication, and project management into one platform. 
It enables real-time collaboration among developers and non-developers.  

### 3. Introduction
- Project Overview:  
  - CollabDev+ is a next-generation collaborative development platform. It 
combines a web-based IDE, task management, file sharing, and integrated 
communication tools (chat, video, screen sharing). A unique website builder 
allows designers to visually build interfaces that sync with live code. The 
platform bridges technical and non-technical team roles, reducing context 
switching and enabling more efficient collaboration.  

### 4. Motivation and Scope
- Motivation:  
  - Software development teams often rely on multiple tools such as IDEs, task 
trackers, chat platforms, design tools, and deployment dashboards. This 
results in fragmented workflows, miscommunication, and difficulty managing 
project context across tools. In addition, collaboration between developers 
and non-technical stakeholders (designers, managers, clients) remains 
challenging due to the technical barrier of traditional IDEs.  
  - CollabDev+ aims to address this by providing a unified platform that 
supports real-time coding, visual design, communication, and project 
management. It reduces the friction of tool switching and improves 
collaboration by allowing all stakeholders to work in one shared environment.  

- Scope:  
  - The project will deliver a working prototype with the following: real-time 
collaborative IDE, project/task management, integrated chat and video calls, 
and a website builder. The scope is limited to a web-based platform, 
targeting small teams, students, an d freelancers. Advanced AI features will 
be considered as stretch goals.  

### 5. Related Work
- Similar Systems:  

  - Existing systems include VS Code Live Share, GitHub Codespaces, Replit, 
Figma, Webflow, Slack,  Code Sandbox  and Jira. These tools address parts of 
the workflow but remain fragmented. CollabDev+ differentiates itself by 
integrating them into one unified, team -centric platform with artifact linking 
and real-time sync between code and design.  

### 6. System Architecture  
- Basic Architecture:  

### 7. Goals and Objectives  
- Final Outcome:  
The expected system will provide:  
1. Real-time collaborative IDE.  
2. Task and project management (Kanban boards, roles, deadlines).  
3. Integrated communication tools (chat, video calls, screen sharing).  
4. Website builder with two-way sync between visual and code views.  
5. Artifact linking between code, tasks, and communications.
